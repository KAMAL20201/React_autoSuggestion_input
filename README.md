# Auto Suggestion Input - Readme

This project is an auto-suggestion input application built with React and Styled Components. It allows users to search for users based on their first name or last name, and as they type, it provides auto-suggestions for matching names. Users can click on a suggestion to populate the input field with the selected user's full name and display their details.

Getting Started
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

## Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/auto_suggestion_input.git`
   
## Navigate to the project directory:
   
   `cd auto_suggestion_input`

## Install Dependencies:
   
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Then, install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   `npm install`

## Starting the Project:

After installing the project dependencies, you can start the development server and run the auto-suggestion input application.

Start the development server:

`npm start`

This will start the development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser. 

If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.


    
## Using the Auto-Suggestion Input:

1. In the search input field, start typing the first name or last name of a user.
    
2. As you type, the application will show auto-suggestions based on the input.
    
3. Click on any suggestion to populate the input field with the selected user's full name.
    
4. The user details will be displayed below the input field.

## Responsive Design:
The application is designed to be responsive and will adjust its layout based on the screen size. You can test the responsiveness by resizing your browser window or using the browser's developer tools.

## Additional Information
1. The data for the user search is fetched from the dummyjson.com API, which generates dummy data for testing purposes.

2. The Styled Components library is used for styling the application, providing a clean and efficient way to manage CSS.

3. The application uses React's useState and useEffect hooks to handle state and side-effects respectively.
